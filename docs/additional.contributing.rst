Contributing
=============

Everyone are very welcome to contribute. 

We share the same values of the `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html>`_ community


.. note::
    We are a community based on openness and friendly, didactic, discussions.

    We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions. We are particularly seeking people 
    from underrepresented backgrounds in Open Source Software and scikit-learn in particular to participate 
    and contribute their expertise and experience.

    Decisions are made based on technical merit and consensus.

    Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests, 
    answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing and teaching tutorials, 
    working on the website, improving the documentation, are all priceless contributions.

    We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of the Python 
    Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

    In case you experience issues using this package, do not hesitate to submit a ticket to the GitHub issue tracker.
